# Problem: Move Zeroes

## Approach
Used two-pointer technique to shift all non-zero elements to the front while maintaining order, then filled remaining positions with zeroes to achieve in-place modification.

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Key Learning
Two-pointer approach helps perform in-place array transformations efficiently while preserving relative order.

## Edge Cases
- All elements are zero  
- No zero present  
- Single element array  
- Large input size
